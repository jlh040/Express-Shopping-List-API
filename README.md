### Express Shopping List App

#### Functionality

- This is an application that utilizes a RESTful shopping list API to allow a user to view, create, update, and delete items in a shopping list. Note that this app was created entirely with Node and Express. Integration tests are provided in **routes.test.js**.

#### Technicalities

- To get this code onto your machine, run `https://github.com/jlh040/Express-Shopping-List-API.git`
- Then, assuming you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, run `npm install` in your terminal to download all of the dependencies.
- After installation, enter `node server.js` in your terminal to start the server up, and then hit any of the RESTful endpoints to utilize your very own shopping list.
- Note that this app was tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).
